This is not your average engineering role. We\u2019re hiring **Engineers** who thrive at the intersection of embedded systems and advanced algorithms. If you're excited about writing software that actually interacts with the physical world, this is your calling.\nGot: Build real-world autonomy \u2014 not just simulations or slides. Work on a highly technical team with a mission to solve cutting-edge robotics problems. Company has $1B+ in commercial pipeline. Take ownership: from algorithm to embedded implementation, all the way to physical deployment. Enjoy a collaborative team culture with equity, bonus, and clear technical impact.",
