      **Principal Engineer (2 Positions)**

      **About the Role**  
      Are you a senior engineer ready to step into a Principal-level role at a fast-growing startup? At Audience Republic, you'll shape not just our codebase but also our engineering culture and technical vision. You’ll lead by example, influence architectural direction across squads, and drive forward major initiatives.  

      **About Audience Republic**  
      Audience Republic is a CRM and marketing platform built for the events industry. We power campaigns for global acts like Taylor Swift and Post Malone by connecting deeply with ticketing platforms such as Ticketmaster and Eventbrite. As a Principal Engineer, your work will scale to support some of the most high-impact marketing teams in the entertainment world.

      **Key Responsibilities**  
        * Define and uphold architectural patterns and scalable system design across multiple teams.  
        * Partner with engineering managers and the CTO to align technical initiatives with business outcomes.  
        * Lead critical projects end-to-end, from discovery to delivery, often across squads.  
        * Mentor engineers through design reviews, pair programming, and tech strategy sessions.  
        * Shape our dev culture—emphasizing quality, speed, and pragmatic decision-making.  
        * Evaluate and introduce relevant AI tooling and event-driven design patterns into the stack.  
        * Stay close to the codebase—especially during greenfield or high-risk development phases.

      **What You Bring**  
        * 6+ years of experience in backend or full-stack development.  
        * Strong systems thinking and knowledge of software design principles.  
        * Deep proficiency in at least one modern language (e.g., Kotlin, C#, Elixir, Scala, Java).  
        * Experience with event streaming (Kafka/RabbitMQ), infrastructure-as-code (CloudFormation/CDK), and cloud-first systems (AWS).  
        * A track record of technical leadership, including mentoring or influencing teams.  
        * Familiarity with distributed systems and microservice orchestration.  
        * Comfort interfacing with senior stakeholders and explaining trade-offs clearly.

      **Bonus**  
        * Experience in high-scale marketing, CRM, or ticketing domains.  
        * Contributions to open-source or involvement in tech communities.  
        * We collaborate remotely most days, but catch up in person midweek for team syncs and espresso
        * Prior work in early-stage startups or environments with rapid iteration cycles.

      If you're a builder, a systems thinker, and a leader who thrives in ambiguity, we'd love to talk.
