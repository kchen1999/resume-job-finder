## Development Setup

Follow these steps to run the app locally with Docker Compose.

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kchen1999/resume-job-finder.git
cd resume-job-finder
```

### 2. Create a .env file in the project root

Include environment variables for all services in a single .env file like:

```ini
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
JINA_API_KEY=your_jina_key
SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn

DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_url
NODE_BACKEND_URL=http://node-backend:3000/api
SCRAPER_BEARER_TOKEN=supersecrettoken
```

### 3. Start the app using Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p dev up --build
```
Open the app at: http://localhost:8081

### 4. üì§ Resume Upload Workflow

- Drag-and-drop a PDF resume into the UI
- LLM extracts structured experiences from the resume
- Each experience is embedded
- Resume is matched to scraped jobs based on vector similarity

The first extracted experience is used for matching by default. You can select others and filter by extracted experiences.
