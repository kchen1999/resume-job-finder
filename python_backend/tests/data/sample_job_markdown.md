Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, 你好, hallo, vítejte! 
Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point. 
**Where and how you can work**
Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work, we trust our Canvanauts to choose the balance that empowers them and their team to achieve their goals. 
**What you’d be doing in this role**
As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve. 
At the moment, this role is focused on: 
  * Collaborating with a backend-focused team of engineers to extend and scale the backbone of our Microservice landscape: the User Platform. 
  * Ensuring high-performance systems to authenticate, authorize, and manage users, avatars, groups, and teams. 
  * Working with the team to envision, design, plan, build, and maintain reusable building blocks for the User Platform. 
  * Communicating with stakeholders to assess requirements, align timelines, and optimize for customer value. 
  * Enhancing the experience for customers with large teams, particularly in Enterprise and Education environments.

  * A collaborative mindset and the ability to communicate effectively with teammates 
  * Strong fundamentals in computer science and engineering, including concurrency, multithreading, data structures, and solution design 
  * Experience designing, building, and maintaining high-performance, large-scale Java backend systems 
  * A problem-solving mentality and a passion for finding innovative solutions 
  * Strong written and verbal communication skills 


Nice to have's 
  * Experience with Authentication and Authorization systems is a huge plus 
  * SQL experience 
  * DynamoDB experience is a plus

**About the Role**
As a senior backend engineer, you'll have the exciting opportunity to build and expand Canva’s User Platform - the essential backbone supporting our millions of daily users. 
Your role will revolve around designing, creating, and maintaining new features that enhance and extend the experience for Pro and Enterprise teams. You'll be crafting building blocks like Permissions and Product Capability controls. 
Constant collaboration with other Canva teams is part of the job, giving you a fantastic opportunity to learn about what everyone else is up to, and connect the dots across projects.
