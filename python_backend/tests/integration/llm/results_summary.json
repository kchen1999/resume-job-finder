This is not your average engineering role. We\u2019re hiring **Engineers** who thrive at the intersection of embedded systems and advanced algorithms. If you're excited about writing software that actually interacts with the physical world, this is your calling.\nGot: Take ownership: from algorithm to embedded implementation, all the way to physical deployment."
